In this section the results of the two experiments, presented in \cref{s:results}, are discussed.

\subsection{One-Dimensional Model}
	
	We have observed that the accuracy increases as the temperature increases and that at very low temperatures the accuracy is very low. This is caused by the Boltzman factor, which is low when the \temperature is low. Thus very few potential states are accepted at a low temperature. Consequently the system `moves slower' and takes longer to end up in the interesting states.
	
	The results in \cref{a:results1D} showed that the accuracy increases as the number of samples increases. The cause for this is that the analytical solutions are based on systems with an infinite number of spins. Consequently system with more spins are closer to systems with $\numberOfSpins = \infty$, and their results are thus closer to those of the infinite system. 

	Another factor that increases the accuracy of the system is the number of samples. Firstly more samples means that the system gets more time to relax. Secondly a higher number of samples decreases the influence of outlier states. Lastly the probability of ending up in a interesting configuration increases as the number of spins that are potentially flipped increases.

	As expected we do not observe a phase transition in the one-dimensional model. 

\subsection{Two-Dimensional Model}
	In line with the theory we have observed that there is a phase transition and that it is approximately critical. In the systems with few spins, $\dimensionality = 10$, the phase transition is hardly visible in the plots. This is due to the analytical results being based on infinite systems. 

	Unfortunately we cannot offer an explanation for the drop in magnetization at $\temperature = 2.1$ in the $10 \times 10$ system with 1000 samples.
