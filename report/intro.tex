A large number of systems change their macroscopic properties at thermal equilibria. For example magnetic atoms align them selves to form a magnetic material at low temperature or high pressure. When modeled mathematically, these phase transitions only occur in infinitely large systems \cite{kenzel1997physics}. This paper investigates a simulation of a finite system that models a system that exhibits macroscopic properties at its thermal equilibrium, the Ising ferromagnet to be exact.

\Cref{ss:intro:ising} introduces the Ising model of ferromagnetism, the next section discusses the Metropolis Monte Carlo method that is used to solve the Ising model numerically.

\Cref{s:method} discusses how the Metropolis Monte Carlo method is used to solve the Ising model. In \cref{s:experiment} the run experiments are introduced, their results are presented in \cref{s:results}. \Cref{s:discussion} discusses the found results and \cref{s:conclusion} concludes this paper.
