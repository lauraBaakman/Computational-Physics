A large number of systems change their macroscopic properties at thermal equilibria. For example magnetic atoms align them selves to form a magnetic material at low temperature or high pressure. When modeled mathematically, these phase transitions only occur in infinitely large systems. This paper investigates if a a simulation of a finite system, the Ising ferromagnet to be exact, can exhibit phase transitions such as the one described above \cite{kenzel1997physics}. 

\Cref{ss:intro:ising} introduces the Ising model of ferromagnetism, the next section discusses the Metropolis Monte Carlo method that is used to estimate the Ising model numerically.
