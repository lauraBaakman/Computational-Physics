Our findings have shown that even a small two-dimensional system with a relatively small number of samples is sufficient to observe a phase transition. However to get results that approximate the analytical solutions of the Ising model one needs to make sure that the system is suffieciently large. Furthermore one should allow the system suffienct time to relax and take a large number of samples.
